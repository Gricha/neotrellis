# Neotrellis 8x8

This project includes a software I've built for [Neotrellis 8x8](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1929) as a toy for my kid.

It includes a couple of simple activities and animations that a toddler can play with. Most of them are well documented in [the toy manual](addlink).

As a demo, here are two examples - Snake & simple animations.
